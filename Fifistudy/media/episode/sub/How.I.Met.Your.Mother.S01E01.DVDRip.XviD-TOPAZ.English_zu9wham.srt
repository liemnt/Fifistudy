1
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:08,237
Kids, I'm gonna tell you
an incredible story.

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,741
The story of how I met your mother.

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,711
- Are we being punished for something?
- No.

4
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:16,441
- Yeah, is this gonna take a while?
- Yes.

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,419
Twenty-five years ago, before I was Dad,
I had this whole other life.

6
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,020
<i>It was way back in 2005,</i>

7
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,790
<i>I was 27, just starting</i>
<i>to make it as an architect</i>

8
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,889
<i>and living in New York with Marshall,</i>
<i>my best friend from college,</i>

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,126
<i>My life was good,</i>

10
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:38,932
<i>And then Uncle Marshall</i>
<i>went and screwed the whole thing up,</i>

11
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,799
Will you marry me?

12
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:42,770
Yes. Perfect.

13
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,640
And then you're engaged,
you pop the champagne, you drink a toast,

14
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,736
you have sex on the kitchen floor.

15
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:50,213
- Don't have sex on our kitchen floor.
- Got it.

16
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,806
Thanks for helping me plan this out, Ted.

17
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,284
Dude, are you kidding? It's you and Lily.

18
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,685
I've been there for all the big moments
of you and Lily.

19
00:00:56,823 --> 00:01:01,157
The night you met,
your first date, other first things.

20
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,394
Yeah, sorry, we thought you were asleep.

21
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:05,623
It's physics, Marshall.

22
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,860
If the bottom bunk moves,
the top bunk moves, too.

23
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:13,639
My God, you're getting engaged tonight.

24
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,174
Yeah. What are you doing tonight?

25
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,544
<i>What was I doing? Here, Uncle Marshall</i>

26
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,172
<i>was taking the biggest step of his life,</i>
<i>And me?</i>

27
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,513
<i>I'm calling up your Uncle Barney,</i>

28
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,314
Hey, so you know how
I've always had a thing for half-Asian girls?

29
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:33,756
Well, now I've got a new favorite.
Lebanese girls.

30
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,756
Lebanese girls are the new half-Asians.

31
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,455
Hey, you wanna do something tonight?

32
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,329
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes.
And suit up!

33
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,999
- Hey.
- Where's your suit?

34
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,598
Just once, when I say "suit up,"
I wish you'd put on a suit.

35
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,145
- I did. That one time.
- It was a blazer.

36
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:58,082
You know, ever since college
it's been Marshall and Lily and me.

37
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,110
Now it's gonna be
Marshall and Lily and me.

38
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,018
They'll get married, start a family.

39
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,182
Before long,
I'm that weird middle-aged bachelor

40
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,418
their kids call "Uncle Ted."

41
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,226
I see what this is about.

42
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,526
Have you forgotten what I said to you
the night we met?

43
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,362
Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.

44
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,740
- Barney. We met at the urinal.
- Oh, right. Hi.

45
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:26,209
Lesson one, lose the goatee.
It doesn't go with your suit.

46
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,906
- I'm not wearing a suit.
- Lesson two, get a suit.

47
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,006
Suits are cool. Exhibit A.

48
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:32,673
Lesson three,

49
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:36,084
don't even think about getting married
till you're 30.

50
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,350
Thirty. Right, you're right.

51
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,323
I guess it's just, your best friend
gets engaged,

52
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:43,623
- you start thinking about that stuff.
- I thought I was your best friend.

53
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,460
Ted, say I'm your best friend.

54
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,161
- You're my best friend, Barney.
- Good.

55
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,965
Then as your best friend, I suggest we play
a little game I like to call,

56
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,299
"Have you met Ted?"

57
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,067
No, no, no, no, we're not playing
"Have you met Ted."

58
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,540
Hi, have you met Ted?

59
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,446
- Hi, I'm Ted.
- Yasmin.

60
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,773
- It's a very pretty name.
- Thanks. It's Lebanese.

61
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,020
Hey.

62
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,683
I'm exhausted.

63
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,157
It was finger-painting day at school
and a 5-year-old boy

64
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,353
got to second base with me.

65
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:21,097
- Wow, you're cooking?
- Yes, I am.

66
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,804
Are you sure that's a good idea
after last time.

67
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,669
You looked really creepy
without eyebrows.

68
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:29,897
I can handle this.

69
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,239
I think you'll find
I'm full of surprises tonight.

70
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,370
So there's more surprises? Like what?

71
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,681
<i>Marshall was in his second year</i>
<i>of law school,</i>

72
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,149
<i>so he was pretty good</i>
<i>at thinking on his feet,</i>

73
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,517
Boogedy boo! And that's all of them.

74
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,988
I'm gonna go cook.

75
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,488
I'm so happy for Marshall, I really am.

76
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,722
I just couldn't imagine settling down
right now.

77
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,357
- So do you think you'll ever get married?
- Well, maybe eventually.

78
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,602
Some fall day. Possibly in Central Park.

79
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,965
Simple ceremony.
We'll write our own vows.

80
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,063
Band, no DJ.

81
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,235
People will dance,
I'm not gonna worry about it.

82
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,437
Damn it, why did Marshall
have to get engaged?

83
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,017
Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning
out his own imaginary wedding, huh?

84
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,713
- Actually, I think it's cute.
- Well, you're clearly drunk.

85
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,788
One more for the lady!

86
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,826
Oh, hey, look what I got.

87
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:27,155
Oh, honey, champagne.

88
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,827
Yeah.

89
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,936
No, you are too old to be scared
to open a bottle of champagne.

90
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,008
I'm not scared.

91
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,009
- Then open it.
- Fine.

92
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,078
Please, open it.

93
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,045
Gosh, you are unbelievable, Marshall.

94
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,743
<i>There are two big questions</i>
<i>a man has to ask in life,</i>

95
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,548
<i>One you plan out for months,</i>
<i>the other just slips out</i>

96
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,350
<i>when you're half-drunk at some bar,</i>

97
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,514
Will you marry me?

98
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,926
You wanna go out sometime?

99
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,790
Of course, you idiot!

100
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,790
I'm sorry, Carl's my boyfriend.

101
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,592
What's up, Carl?

102
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,075
I promised Ted we wouldn't do that.

103
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,843
Did you know there's a Pop-Tart
under your fridge?

104
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,504
No, but dibs.

105
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,147
Where's that champagne?

106
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,653
I wanna drink a toast with my fiancée.

107
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,618
I don't know why I was so scared of this.

108
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,126
It's pretty easy, right?

109
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,229
Why am I freaking out all of a sudden?
This is crazy.

110
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,858
I'm not ready to settle down.

111
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,163
How does Carl land a Lebanese girl?

112
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,896
The plan's always been

113
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,564
don't even think about it until you're 30.

114
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,767
Exactly. The guy doesn't even own a suit.

115
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,410
Plus, Marshall's found the love of his life.

116
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,742
Even if I was ready, which I'm not,

117
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:53,581
but if I was, it's like,
"Okay, I'm ready. Where is she?"

118
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,150
<i>And there she was,</i>

119
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,189
<i>It was like something from an old movie</i>

120
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,428
<i>where the sailor sees the girl</i>
<i>across the crowded dance floor,</i>

121
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,299
<i>turns to his buddy and says,</i>

122
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,238
<i>"See that girl?</i>
<i>I'm gonna marry her someday,"</i>

123
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,376
Hey, Barney, see that girl?

124
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,174
Oh, yeah. You just know she likes it dirty.

125
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,845
- Go say hi.
- I can't just go say hi.

126
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,345
I need a plan.

127
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,976
I'm gonna wait
until she goes to the bathroom,

128
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,555
then I'll strategically place myself
by the jukebox so that...

129
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,419
Hi, have you met Ted?

130
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,449
Hi.

131
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,519
Let me guess. Ted.

132
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,426
I'm sorry, Lily.

133
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,833
I'm so sorry. Take us to the hospital.

134
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,269
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you hit her?

135
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,798
Hit me? Please.

136
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,743
This guy can barely even spank me
in bed for fun.

137
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,508
He's all, like, "Oh, honey, did that hurt?"

138
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,483
And I'm, like,
"Come on, let me have you, you pansy."

139
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,744
- Wow, a complete stranger.
- No, no, no, it's okay. Go on.

140
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,057
So, these spankings,

141
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,185
are you in pajamas or <i>au natural?</i>

142
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,256
- So what do you do?
- I'm a reporter for Metro News 1.

143
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,834
- Oh.
- Well, kind of a reporter.

144
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,403
I do those dumb little fluff pieces
at the end of the news.

145
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:22,736
You know, like,
"Monkey who can play the ukulele."

146
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,901
But I'm hoping to get some
bigger stories soon.

147
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:28,105
Bigger, like,
"Gorilla with an upright bass?"

148
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,704
Sorry. You're really pretty.

149
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,851
- Oh, your friends don't seem too happy.
- Yeah.

150
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,980
See, the one in the middle
just got dumped by her boyfriend.

151
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,650
So tonight, every guy is "the enemy."

152
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,057
You know,
if it'll make your friend feel better

153
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,652
you could throw a drink in my face.
I don't mind.

154
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:48,766
She would love that.
And it does look fun in the movies.

155
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,267
Hey, you wanna have dinner with me
Saturday night?

156
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,339
Oh, I can't.
I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday.

157
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,068
Some guy's attempting
to make the world's biggest pancake.

158
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,440
- Guess who's covering it?
- That's gonna take a week?

159
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,877
Yeah, he's gonna eat it, too.
It's another record.

160
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,142
Hey, what's taking so long?

161
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:08,544
I know this is a long shot,
but how about tomorrow night?

162
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,379
Yeah. What the hell.

163
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,627
Jerk!

164
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:20,999
That was fun.

165
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,901
De... Wait for it... nied.

166
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,197
Denied.

167
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:27,965
We're going out tomorrow night.

168
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,565
I thought we were playing
Lazer Tag tomorrow night.

169
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,543
Yeah, I was never gonna go play
Lazer Tag.

170
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,582
<i>The next night, I took her out</i>
<i>to this little bistro in Brooklyn,</i>

171
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,044
Wow.

172
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:44,611
- That is one bad-ass blue French horn.
- Yeah.

173
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,955
Sort of looks like a Smurf penis.

174
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,823
<i>Son, a piece of advice,</i>

175
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,831
<i>When you go on a first date,</i>
<i>you really don't want to say Smurf penis,</i>

176
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,299
<i>Girls don't ordinarily like that,</i>

177
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,071
<i>But this was no ordinary girl,</i>

178
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,907
Lily.

179
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,006
How long have you been sitting there?

180
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,208
Stupid eye patch.

181
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:17,885
Mom, Dad,
I have found the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.

182
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,185
Marshall, how have I always described
my perfect woman?

183
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,920
Let's see.

184
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,017
She likes dogs?

185
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,494
I've got five dogs.

186
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,621
She drinks Scotch?

187
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,666
I love a Scotch
that's old enough to order its own Scotch.

188
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,599
Can quote obscure lines from
<i>Ghostbusters?</i>

189
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:34,696
"Ray, when someone asks you
if you're a God, you say, 'Yes!"'

190
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,969
And I'm saving the best for last.

191
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,404
Do you want these? I hate olives.

192
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:44,344
- She hates olives. Awesome!
- The Olive Theory.

193
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,448
The Olive Theory
is based on my friends, Marshall and Lily.

194
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,544
He hates olives, she loves them.
And in a weird way,

195
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,350
that's what makes them
such a great couple.

196
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,788
Perfect balance.

197
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:57,892
You know, I've had a jar of olives
just sitting in my fridge forever.

198
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,798
I could take them off your hands.

199
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,028
They're all yours.

200
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,032
Oh, it is on!

201
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,606
It is on till the break of dawn.

202
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,975
But, wait, it's only the break of 10:30.
What happened?

203
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,049
I gotta get one of those blue French horns
for over my fireplace.

204
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,879
It's gotta be blue, it's gotta be French.

205
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,317
- No green clarinet?
- Nope.

206
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,819
Come on, no purple tuba?

207
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,447
It's a Smurf penis or no dice.

208
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,448
There you are!

209
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,586
We got a jumper.
Some crazy guy on the Manhattan Bridge.

210
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,789
Come on, you're covering it.

211
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,289
All right, I'll be right there.

212
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,767
I'm sorry.

213
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,804
I had a really great time tonight.

214
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,608
Yeah, well.

215
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,605
So, did you kiss her?

216
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,135
No, the moment wasn't right.

217
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,271
Look, this woman
could actually be my future wife.

218
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,145
I want our first kiss to be amazing.

219
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,844
Oh, Ted, that is so sweet.

220
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,751
So, you chickened out like a little bitch.

221
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,049
What? I did not chicken out.

222
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,252
You know what?
I don't need to take first kiss advice

223
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,797
from some pirate who hasn't been single
since the first week of college.

224
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,389
Ted, anyone who's single
would tell you the same thing.

225
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,969
Even the dumbest single person alive.

226
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,229
And if you don't believe me, call him.

227
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:20,002
Hey, loser, how's not playing Lazer Tag?
Because playing Lazer Tag is awesome.

228
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,608
Oh, I killed you, Connor.
Don't make me get your mom.

229
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,706
Hey, listen,
I need your opinion on something.

230
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,513
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes.
And suit up!

231
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,788
So, these guys think I chickened out.
What do you think?

232
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:36,124
I can't believe
you're still not wearing a suit.

233
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,560
She didn't even give me the signal.

234
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,758
What, is she gonna
bat her eyes at you in Morse code?

235
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,925
"Ted,

236
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,194
"kiss me."

237
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,899
- No, you just kiss her.
- Not if you don't get the signal.

238
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,578
- Did Marshall give me the signal?
- No!

239
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,443
I didn't, I swear.

240
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,845
But, see, at least tonight,
I get to sleep knowing Marshall and me,

241
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,683
never gonna happen.
You should've kissed her.

242
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,313
I should've kissed her.

243
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,392
Well, maybe in a week
when she gets back from Orlando.

244
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,859
A week? That's like a year in hot-girl time.

245
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:10,986
She'll forget all about you.

246
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:14,396
Mark my words,
you will never see that one again.

247
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,331
There she is.

248
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,360
She's cute. Hey, Carl, turn it up.

249
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,364
<i>...persuaded him to reconsider,</i>

250
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,772
<i>At which point</i>
<i>the man came down off the ledge,</i>

251
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,504
<i>giving this bizarre story a happy ending,</i>

252
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,106
<i>Reporting from Metro 1 News,</i>

253
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,205
<i>- back to you, Bill,</i>
- The guy didn't jump.

254
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,545
I'm gonna go kiss her.

255
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,812
- Right now.
- Look, dude, it's midnight.

256
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,856
As your future lawyer,
I'm gonna advise you that's freaking crazy.

257
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,255
I never do anything crazy.

258
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,987
I'm always waiting for the moment,
planning the moment.

259
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,154
Well, she's leaving tomorrow
and this may be the only moment

260
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,458
I'm gonna get.

261
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:50,092
I gotta do what that guy couldn't.
I gotta take the leap.

262
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,897
Okay, not a perfect metaphor

263
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,528
'cause for me
it's fall in love and get married

264
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,539
and for him it's death.

265
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,567
Actually, that is a perfect metaphor.

266
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,241
By the way, did I congratulate you two?

267
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,415
- I'm doing this.
- Let's go.

268
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,985
- Word up.
- We're coming with you.

269
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,614
Barney?

270
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,291
All right, but under one condition.

271
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:17,187
Look at you, you beautiful bastard,
you suited up.

272
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,662
This is totally going in my blog.

273
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,159
Stop the car. Pull over right here.

274
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,000
I gotta do something.

275
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,838
Excuse me. Pardon me, just a sec.

276
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,441
- Enjoy your coffee.
- Hey!

277
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,010
Hey!

278
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,005
Go, go, go!

279
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,884
Everybody brings flowers.

280
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,625
Okay, moment of truth.

281
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:52,592
- Wish me luck.
- Ted's gonna get it on with a TV reporter.

282
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,292
"This just in." Okay.

283
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:02,034
- Kiss her, Ted. Kiss her good.
- Kiss the crap out of that girl.

284
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,234
Marshall, remember this night.

285
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,903
When you're the best man at our wedding
and you give a speech,

286
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,604
you're gonna tell this story.

287
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,407
Why does he get to be the best man?

288
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,486
I'm your best friend!

289
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,987
<i>As I walked up to that door,</i>
<i>a million thoughts raced through my mind,</i>

290
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,491
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>one particular thought did not,</i>

291
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,061
I've got five dogs.

292
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,127
<i>Not good, not good,</i>

293
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,393
- No!
- Get back in there.

294
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,127
You're wearing a suit!

295
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,163
Ted?

296
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,197
Hi.

297
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,302
I was just...

298
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,882
Come on up.

299
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,248
He's in.

300
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,789
So, Ranjit, you must have done it
with a Lebanese girl?

301
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,159
Okay, that's my Barney limit.

302
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,459
I'm gonna see
if that bodega has a bathroom.

303
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,302
Actually, I'm from Bangladesh.

304
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,930
- The women hot there?
- Here's a picture of my wife.

305
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,043
A simple "no"
would have sufficed.

306
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,245
She's lovely.

307
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:21,146
So, Ted, what brings you back to Brooklyn
at 1:00 in the morning in a suit?

308
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,518
I was just hoping to

309
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,756
get those olives

310
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,185
that you said I could have.

311
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,355
Would you like those olives
with some gin and vermouth?

312
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,728
Are you trying to get me drunk?

313
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,634
For starters.

314
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,903
Thank you.

315
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,116
So, Marshall,
this Olive Theory based on you and Lily.

316
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,911
- Yeah.
- You hate olives.

317
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:56,215
- Lily loves them, you can't stand them.
- Yeah, I hate olives.

318
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,517
Two weeks ago,
Spanish bar on 79th Street.

319
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,024
Dish of olives. You had some. What up?

320
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,530
You have to swear
that this does not leave this cab.

321
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,758
- I swear.
- I swear.

322
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,505
On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad.

323
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,699
Lily asked if she could have my olives.

324
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,209
I said, "Sure, I hate olives."

325
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,972
But you like olives.

326
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,640
Well, I was 18, okay? I was a virgin.

327
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,718
Been waiting my whole life
for a pretty girl to want my olives.

328
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,013
Marshall, I'm gonna give you
an early wedding present.

329
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,750
Don't get married.

330
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,766
I think I like your Olive Theory.

331
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,927
I think I like your new French horn.

332
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,407
I think I like your nose.

333
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,470
I think I'm in love with you.

334
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,567
What?

335
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,646
What?

336
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:55,714
What?

337
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,007
Come on, man, you said your stomach's
been hurting, right?

338
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:01,883
You know what that is? Hunger.
You're hungry for experience.

339
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:05,889
Hungry for something new.
Hungry for olives.

340
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,816
But you're too scared
to do anything about it.

341
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,952
Yeah, I'm scared, okay?

342
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,865
But when I think of spending
the rest of my life with Lily,

343
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,493
committing forever, no other women,

344
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,539
doesn't scare me at all.

345
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,072
I'm marrying that girl.

346
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:26,769
Lily.

347
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,376
Lily, I like olives.

348
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,077
We'll make it work.

349
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,927
So, Orlando? You gonna hit Disney World?

350
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,460
- You love me?
- Oh, God.

351
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,638
I can't believe I said that.
Why did I say that?

352
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,229
Who says that?

353
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,867
- I should just go.
- Hold on.

354
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,944
Wait a minute.

355
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,678
I promised you these.

356
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:04,805
- Olives.
- Yeah.

357
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,714
Thanks. I love you.

358
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,650
What is wrong with me?

359
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,387
Why are we still sitting here? Let's go.
We can still make last call.

360
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:16,928
What do you say, Lil?
"Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum"?

361
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:23,294
- 'Cause you're a pirate?
- Okay, eye patch gone.

362
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,793
And we can't just abandon Ted.

363
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,996
If it doesn't go well up there,
he's gonna need some support.

364
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,043
It's been, like, 20 minutes.
Do you think they're doing it?

365
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,668
You think they're doing it
in front of the dogs?

366
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,371
Doggie style.

367
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,740
I knew this girl in college,
she had this Golden Retriever...

368
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,943
Okay, we can go to the bar.
Just stop talking.

369
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,314
Hit it, Ranjit.

370
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,851
So, when you tell this story
to your friends,

371
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,895
could you avoid the word "psycho"?

372
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,391
I'd prefer "eccentric."

373
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,164
Goodnight, psycho.

374
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:01,873
Great.

375
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,401
- How do I get to the F train?
- Oh.

376
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,743
- Two blocks, that way and take a right.
- Thanks.

377
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,140
You know what?

378
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,551
I'm done being single. I'm not good at it.

379
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,584
Look, obviously,
you can't tell a woman you just met

380
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:24,458
you love her, but it sucks that you can't.

381
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,831
I'll tell you something, though. If a woman,

382
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,766
not you, just some hypothetical woman,

383
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,531
were to bear with me through all this,

384
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:37,075
I think I'd make a damn good husband
because that's the stuff I'd be good at.

385
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:41,044
Stuff like making her laugh
and being a good father

386
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,607
and walking her five hypothetical dogs.

387
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,642
Being a good kisser.

388
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,813
- Everyone thinks they're a good kisser.
- Oh, I've got references.

389
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,049
Goodnight, Ted.

390
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,364
- And I'm a good handshaker.
- That's a pretty great handshake.

391
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,839
And that was it.
I'll probably never see her again.

392
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,681
- What?
- That was the signal.

393
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:21,310
That long, lingering handshake.
You should've kissed her.

394
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,278
There's no such thing as the signal.

395
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,653
But, yeah, that was the signal.

396
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:27,952
Signal.

397
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,596
Carl, thank you.
There's something I gotta do.

398
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,359
By the way, you should've kissed her.

399
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,829
Carl, you guys weren't there.

400
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,665
I am so turned on right now.

401
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,440
Guys, trust me. I've seen the signal.

402
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:50,613
- That was not the signal.
- Yeah, Ted, we're not on you anymore.

403
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,616
- To my fiancée.
- To the future.

404
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,585
To one hell of a night.

405
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,026
That was not the signal.

406
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:07,364
<i>I asked her about it years later,</i>
<i>and, yeah, that was the signal,</i>

407
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,865
<i>I could've kissed her,</i>

408
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:12,801
<i>But that's the funny thing about destiny,</i>
<i>it happens whether you plan it or not,</i>

409
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,929
<i>I mean, I never thought</i>
<i>I'd see that girl again,</i>

410
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,166
<i>But it turns out,</i>

411
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,403
<i>I was just too close to the puzzle</i>
<i>to see the picture that was forming,</i>

412
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,979
Because that, kids, is the true story

413
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,241
of how I met your Aunt Robin.

414
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,841
Aunt Robin?

415
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,715
I thought this was how you met Mom.

416
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,845
Will you relax? I'm getting to it.

417
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,689
Like I said, it's a long story.
